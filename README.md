Jaguar is an endangered animal. It is said that there are less than 20 jaguars in the world currently, one
of which is now living in the national zoo of Peru. In order to protect this jaguar, Peruvians singled out a
pitch of land in the zoo for it, where there are herds of cattle, sheep and deer for the jaguar to eat. Anyone
who has visited the zoo praised it to be the "Heaven of Tiger". However, strange enough, no one has ever
seen the jaguar prey on the cattle and sheep. What we could see is its lying in its house eating and sleeping.
